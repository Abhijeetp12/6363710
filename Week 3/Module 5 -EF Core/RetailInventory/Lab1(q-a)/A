1. What is ORM?
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that facilitates the interaction between object-oriented programming languages and relational databases. 
In the context of C#, ORM enables developers to represent database tables as C# classes, where each class corresponds to a table and each property maps to a column in that table. 
This abstraction allows developers to perform database operations such as insert, update, delete, and query using object-oriented syntax rather than writing raw SQL queries.

Benefits of ORM:
Increased Productivity: Developers can work directly with objects in the application code without manually handling SQL statements.
Improved Maintainability: Changes in the data model can be managed through code-first migrations, reducing the need to alter SQL scripts manually.
Abstraction from SQL: ORM handles the underlying SQL generation and database interaction, allowing developers to focus on business logic instead of database syntax.

2. EF Core vs. Entity Framework (EF6)

Entity Framework (EF) is Microsoft's ORM framework for .NET. It exists in two primary versions: Entity Framework 6 (EF6) and Entity Framework Core (EF Core).
While both serve the purpose of bridging the gap between C# objects and relational databases, they differ significantly in architecture and capabilities.

Entity Framework Core (EF Core):
Designed to be lightweight and modular.
Cross-platform compatibility, supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Offers modern features such as asynchronous LINQ queries, support for NoSQL providers, and compiled queries.
Continues to receive active updates and feature enhancements from Microsoft.

Entity Framework 6 (EF6):
Limited to the Windows platform and built on the older .NET Framework.
Considered more mature and stable, especially for legacy enterprise applications.
Lacks some modern functionalities like cross-platform support and certain performance optimizations found in EF Core.
Generally not recommended for new applications due to its limited flexibility and development activity.

3. Key Features Introduced in EF Core 8.0

Entity Framework Core 8.0 introduces a range of enhancements aimed at improving performance, flexibility, and data handling capabilities. 
These features are particularly beneficial for modern application development involving large datasets and dynamic data structures.

Features:
JSON Column Mapping: Enables mapping JSON data stored in database columns directly to C# objects, allowing better handling of semi-structured data.
Compiled Models: Improves application startup and query execution performance by allowing models to be compiled ahead of time.
Interceptors: Offers the ability to intercept database commands, which is useful for implementing custom logging, validation, or monitoring logic during query execution.
Improved Bulk Operations: Enhances the performance and reliability of bulk data operations, which is essential for applications that manage large volumes of records efficiently.
