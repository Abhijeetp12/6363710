1) Understanding Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms play a vital role in organizing data efficiently, e
specially in applications such as e-commerce platforms where performance and speed are crucial. 
Below are some widely used sorting techniques:

Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements in a list and
swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.
Although easy to understand and implement, Bubble Sort is not efficient for large datasets due to its high time complexity.

Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the sorted list one element at a time by picking an item and placing it in
its appropriate position relative to the already sorted elements. It resembles the way a person
arranges playing cards in order. This method works efficiently for small datasets or nearly sorted data.

Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy.
It selects a pivot element, partitions the array into two sub-arrays—one with elements less than 
the pivot and one with elements greater than the pivot—and then recursively sorts the sub-arrays. 
Due to its efficiency and performance on large datasets, Quick Sort is widely preferred in real-world applications.

Merge Sort
Merge Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input list into halves, 
recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves into a single sorted list. 
It guarantees consistent performance and is especially useful for sorting linked lists or 
large datasets where stable sorting is required.

2) Performance Analysis (Bubble Sort vs Quick Sort)
When it comes to performance, not all sorting algorithms are equal.

Bubble Sort is very basic and easy to understand, but it’s slow. 
It compares every item with every other item, which takes a lot of time for big lists. 
Its performance doesn’t improve much even if the list is almost sorted.

Quick Sort, on the other hand, is much faster. It doesn't check each item one by one 
like Bubble Sort. Instead, it quickly narrows down where items should go using the 
divide-and-conquer approach. For most real-world cases, Quick Sort is much better and more efficient.
