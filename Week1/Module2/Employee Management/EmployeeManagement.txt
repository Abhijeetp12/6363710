1. Understanding Array Representation
In programming, an array is a collection of elements stored in a continuous block of memory. 
Each element can be accessed using its index, starting from zero.
Arrays are beneficial when need to store a fixed number of items of the same type,
such as a list of employees. Since all items are stored in adjacent memory locations, 
accessing any element is very fast. This makes arrays ideal for tasks that require quick retrieval 
of data.

4. Analysis

Each operation in the employee management system has a different time complexity:

Add: Adding an employee at the end of the array takes constant time—O(1)—if there is available space.

Search: Searching through the array requires checking each element until a match is found, so the time complexity is O(n).

Traverse: Visiting every employee in the list also takes O(n) time.

Delete: Deleting an element may require shifting the remaining elements, making the time complexity O(n).

While arrays are efficient for fast access and simple to use, they have a major limitation: their size is fixed once declared. 
This means they’re not suitable for cases where the number of records can change frequently. In such dynamic situations, data structures like lists or linked lists are more appropriate.
